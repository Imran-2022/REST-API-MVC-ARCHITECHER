-  what to do ?
- we will follow MVC architecture.
- routes demo.
    - /users->GET-> {id,username,email}
    - /users/->POST->{username,email}
    - /users/:id->PUT-> update the user
    - /users/:id->DELETE->delete the user

- command : npm init -y && npm i express nodemon cors dotenv uvid(to create unique id)
- maybe you know - what is routing, what is controller.
